# OpenAPI Documentation for our "catch-all" API route
# We have to assign the catch-all in multiple places,
# So define it once in this file so it can be included
# multiple times, e.g. $ref: "./catch_all.yml"

  summary: Reserved for internal use, remove from public documentation
  description: Catch-all API route to cover any paths/methods that are not
    supported, and return a "nice" error message (e.g. 404).  We COULD 
    achieve something similar by customizing the Gateway Responses, but 
    the response for unsupported API method or resource is the same as 
    Missing Authentication Token, which is unhelpful.
  responses:
    '404':
      $ref: "./responses.yml#/404"
  # No security on this route, 404s are public.
