# OpenAPI Documentation for standard HTTP responses.
# Other files can reference these to provide a canned response description.
# For example:
#   responses:
#     $ref: "./responses.yml"
# You can also reference specific response codes, which allows you to use
# the canned description for some responses but not others.
#   responses:
#     '200':
#       description: 'My custom description'
#     '400':
#       $ref: "./responses.yml#/400"
#     '401':
#       $ref: "./responses.yml#/401"
#     '403':
#       $ref: "./responses.yml#/403"
#     '404':
#       $ref: "./responses.yml#/404"

'200':
  description: Call was successful.  If the API returns data, it will be 
    present in the response body in JSON format.
'400':
  description: Server could not process the request, usually due to a 
    missing or incorrectly formatted parameter.  Check the response body for
    a message and/or error code.
'401':
  description: Client is not properly authenticated.  Make sure the HTTP 
    Authorization header was included in the request, and the token has not 
    expired.
'403':
  description: Client is authenticated, but does not have permission to 
    perform this operation.  Your access level may be too low (e.g. you need
    admin), or you may not be a member of the organization/fleet where this 
    object exists.
'404':
  description: The specified API route could not be found.  It may not exist, 
    or it may refer to an object in an organization/fleet that you are not a 
    member of, and is therefore "invisible" to you.'
